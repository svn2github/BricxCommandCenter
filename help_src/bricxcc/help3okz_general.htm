<P>Here you can set some general properties. 
First of all, you can indicate whether you want that window positions are saved between sessions. 
You can also indicate whether or not backup copies are made of files that you are overwriting. Backup copies have an extension .BAK.
You can indicate whether you want a list of recently opened files to be displayed at the bottom of the <B>File</B> menu.
You can control whether a compiler status message is displayed.
You can have BricxCC save the binary compiler output to a file on your computer.
You can force the toolbars to remain locked in their default positions.
You can make it so that MDI editor windows are automatically maximized when they are opened.
You can set the clipboard copy function to use multiple formats rather than just plain text.
You can configure BricxCC to run in MDI mode or in a tabbed-document mode.  This option requires restarting BricxCC for it to take effect.
You can turn on auto save of editor files before compiling.  
You can turn on auto save of the project desktop before compiling.  A project desktop is a .dsk file named after the source code file which contains window size and position settings which will be automatically restored when you open the source code file. 
You can make it so that files that you open using drag and drop will also be added to the recently opened files list.
And you can configure the maximum number of recent files to include on the <b>File</b> menu when you have the "Display recently opened files in menu" option selected.
</P>
<p>
For the RCX brick you can configure a few more options:
</p>
<p>
You can select to use fast mode when downloading the firmware. This can be modified to use 2x instead of 4x speed.
You can choose to have the firmware download be quiet when it finishes.
You can lock and unlock program slots.
You can also specify a firmware chunk size in bytes and a download wait time in milliseconds.
</p>
<p>
Press the <B>Default</B> button to return to the default settings.  
Press <B>OK</B> to save the changes. 
Press <B>Cancel</B> if you don’t want to change them after all.
